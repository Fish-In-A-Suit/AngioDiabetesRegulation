Introduction to Gene Ontology:
    - GO Annotation = a statement about the function of a particular gene (created by associating
      a gene / gene product with a GO Term). It includes statements about
         (1) how the gene functions at the molecular level
         (2) where in the cell it functions and
         (3) what biological pathways it helps carry out.
      At the minimum, an annotation consists of:
         (1) Gene product (may be a protein, RNA, etc)
         (2) GO term
         (3) Reference
         (4) Evidence (go evidence codes: http://geneontology.org/docs/guide-go-evidence-codes/)
      Additionally, annotations can be equipped with 'annotation qualifiers': NOT, contributes_to, colocalizes_with
