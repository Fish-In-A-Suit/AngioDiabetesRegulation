Its targets include: protein kinase B (PKB/AKT1, PKB/AKT2, PKB/AKT3), p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KB1), p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6KA1, RPS6KA2 and RPS6KA3), cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKACA), protein kinase C (PRKCD and PRKCZ), serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1, SGK2 and SGK3), p21-activated kinase-1 (PAK1), protein kinase PKN (PKN1 and PKN2). Plays a central role in the transduction of signals from insulin by providing the activating phosphorylation to PKB/AKT1, thus propagating the signal to downstream targets controlling cell proliferation and survival, as well as glucose and amino acid uptake and storage. Negatively regulates the TGF-beta-induced signaling by: modulating the association of SMAD3 and SMAD7 with TGF-beta receptor, phosphorylating SMAD2, SMAD3, SMAD4 and SMAD7, preventing the nuclear translocation of SMAD3 and SMAD4 and the translocation of SMAD7 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in response to TGF-beta. Activates PPARG transcriptional activity and promotes adipocyte differentiation. Activates the NF-kappa-B pathway via phosphorylation of IKKB. The tyrosine phosphorylated form is crucial for the regulation of focal adhesions by angiotensin II. Controls proliferation, survival, and growth of developing pancreatic cells. Participates in the regulation of Ca(2+) entry and Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels of mast cells. Essential for the motility of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and is involved in the regulation of their chemotaxis. Plays a critical role in cardiac homeostasis by serving as a dual effector for cell survival and beta-adrenergic response. Plays an important role during thymocyte development by regulating the expression of key nutrient receptors on the surface of pre-T cells and mediating Notch-induced cell growth and proliferative responses. Provides negative feedback inhibition to toll-like receptor-mediated NF-kappa-B activation in macrophages.

Involved in terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes to plasma cells and production of immunoglobulins (PubMed:11460154). Modulates the cellular response to ER stress in a PIK3R-dependent manner (PubMed:20348923). Binds to the cis-acting X box present in the promoter regions of major histocompatibility complex class II genes (PubMed:8349596). Involved in VEGF-induced endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and retinal blood vessel formation during embryonic development but also for angiogenesis in adult tissues under ischemic conditions. Functions also as a major regulator of the UPR in obesity-induced insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes for the management of obesity and diabetes prevention (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O35426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460154, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20348923, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8349596}.  FUNCTION: [Isoform 1]: Plays a role in the unconventional cytoplasmic splicing processing of its own mRNA triggered by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane endoribonuclease ERN1: upon ER stress, the emerging XBP1 polypeptide chain, as part of a mRNA-ribosome-nascent chain (R-RNC) complex, cotranslationally recruits its own unprocessed mRNA through transient docking to the ER membrane and translational pausing, therefore facilitating efficient IRE1-mediated XBP1 mRNA isoform 2 production (PubMed:19394296, PubMed:21233347). In endothelial cells (EC), associated with KDR, promotes IRE1-mediated XBP1 mRNA isoform 2 productions in a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- dependent manner, leading to EC proliferation and angiogenesis (PubMed:23529610). Functions as a negative feed-back regulator of the potent transcription factor XBP1 isoform 2 protein levels through proteasome-mediated degradation, thus preventing the constitutive activation of the ER stress response signaling pathway (PubMed:16461360, PubMed:25239945). Inhibits the transactivation activity of XBP1 isoform 2 in myeloma cells (By similarity). Acts as a weak transcriptional factor (PubMed:8657566). Together with HDAC3, contributes to the activation of NFE2L2-mediated HMOX1 transcription factor gene expression in a PI(3)K/mTORC2/Akt-dependent signaling pathway leading to EC survival under disturbed flow/oxidative stress (PubMed:25190803). Binds to the ER stress response element (ERSE) upon ER stress (PubMed:11779464). Binds to the consensus 5'- GATGACGTG[TG]N(3)[AT]T-3' sequence related to cAMP responsive element (CRE)-like sequences (PubMed:8657566).

FUNCTION: [Isoform 2]: Functions as a stress-inducible potent transcriptional activator during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by inducing unfolded protein response (UPR) target genes via binding to the UPR element (UPRE). Up-regulates target genes encoding ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) components to enhance the capacity of productive folding and degradation mechanism, respectively, in order to maintain the homeostasis of the ER under ER stress (PubMed:11779464, PubMed:25239945). Plays a role in the production of immunoglobulins and interleukin-6 in the presence of stimuli required for plasma cell differentiation (By similarity). Induces phospholipid biosynthesis and ER expansion (PubMed:15466483). Contributes to the VEGF-induced endothelial cell (EC) growth and proliferation in a Akt/GSK-dependent and/or -independent signaling pathway, respectively, leading to beta-catenin nuclear translocation and E2F2 gene expression (PubMed:23529610). Promotes umbilical vein EC apoptosis and atherosclerotisis development in a caspase-dependent signaling pathway, and contributes to VEGF-induced EC proliferation and angiogenesis in adult tissues under ischemic conditions (PubMed:19416856, PubMed:23529610). Involved in the regulation of endostatin-induced autophagy in EC through BECN1 transcriptional activation (PubMed:23184933). Plays a role as an oncogene by promoting tumor progression: stimulates zinc finger protein SNAI1 transcription to induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition, cell migration and invasion of breast cancer cells (PubMed:25280941). Involved in adipocyte differentiation by regulating lipogenic gene expression during lactation. Plays a role in the survival of both dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), by maintaining protein homeostasis and of myeloma cells. Increases insulin sensitivity in the liver as a response to a high carbohydrate diet, resulting in improved glucose tolerance. Improves also glucose homeostasis in an ER stress- and/or insulin-independent manner through both binding and proteasome-induced degradation of the transcription factor FOXO1, hence resulting in suppression of gluconeogenic genes expression and in a reduction of blood glucose levels. Controls the induction of de novo fatty acid synthesis in hepatocytes by regulating the expression of a subset of lipogenic genes in an ER stress- and UPR-independent manner (By similarity). Associates preferentially to the HDAC3 gene promoter region in a disturbed flow-dependent manner (PubMed:25190803). Binds to the BECN1 gene promoter region (PubMed:23184933).

Plays a key role in B-cell activation by regulating BCR- induced NF-kappa-B activation. Mediates the activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B pathway (NFKB1) by direct phosphorylation of CARD11/CARMA1 at 'Ser-559', 'Ser-644' and 'Ser-652'. Phosphorylation induces CARD11/CARMA1 association with lipid rafts and recruitment of the BCL10-MALT1 complex as well as MAP3K7/TAK1, which then activates IKK complex, resulting in nuclear translocation and activation of NFKB1. Plays a direct role in the negative feedback regulation of the BCR signaling, by down-modulating BTK function via direct phosphorylation of BTK at 'Ser-180', which results in the alteration of BTK plasma membrane localization and in turn inhibition of BTK activity (PubMed:11598012). Involved in apoptosis following oxidative damage: in case of oxidative conditions, specifically phosphorylates 'Ser-36' of isoform p66Shc of SHC1, leading to mitochondrial accumulation of p66Shc, where p66Shc acts as a reactive oxygen species producer. Acts as a coactivator of androgen receptor (AR)-dependent transcription, by being recruited to AR target genes and specifically mediating phosphorylation of 'Thr-6' of histone H3 (H3T6ph), a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation that prevents demethylation of histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me) by LSD1/KDM1A (PubMed:20228790). In insulin signaling, may function downstream of IRS1 in muscle cells and mediate insulin-dependent DNA synthesis through the RAF1-MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. Participates in the regulation of glucose transport in adipocytes by negatively modulating the insulin-stimulated translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4. Phosphorylates SLC2A1/GLUT1, promoting glucose uptake by SLC2A1/GLUT1 (PubMed:25982116). Under high glucose in pancreatic beta-cells, is probably involved in the inhibition of the insulin gene transcription, via regulation of MYC expression. In endothelial cells, activation of PRKCB induces increased phosphorylation of RB1, increased VEGFA-induced cell proliferation, and inhibits PI3K/AKT-dependent nitric oxide synthase (NOS3/eNOS) regulation by insulin, which causes endothelial dysfunction.

Following transinteraction, ligand cells produce mechanical force that depends of a clathrin-mediated endocytosis, requiring ligand ubiquitination, EPN1 interaction, and actin polymerisation; these events promote Notch receptor extracellular domain (NECD) transendocytosis and triggers Notch signaling through induction of cleavage, hyperphosphorylation, and nuclear accumulation of the intracellular domain of Notch receptors (NICD) (By similarity). Is required for embryonic development and maintenance of adult stem cells in many different tissues and immune systeme; the DLL1-induced Notch signaling is mediated through an intercellular communication that regulates cell lineage, cell specification, cell patterning and morphogenesis through effects on differentiation and proliferation (PubMed:11581320). Plays a role in brain development at different level, namely by regulating neuronal differentiation of neural precursor cells via cell-cell interaction, most likely through the lateral inhibitory system in an endogenous level dependent-manner. During neocortex development, Dll1-Notch signaling transmission is mediated by dynamic interactions between intermediate neurogenic progenitors and radial glia; the cell-cell interactions are mediated via dynamic and transient elongation processes, likely to reactivate/maintain Notch activity in neighboring progenitors, and coordinate progenitor cell division and differentiation across radial and zonal boundaries. During cerebellar development, regulates Bergmann glial monolayer formation and its morphological maturation through a Notch signaling pathway. At the retina and spinal cord level, regulates neurogenesis by preventing the premature differentiation of neural progenitors and also by maintaining progenitors in spinal cord through Notch signaling pathway. Also controls neurogenesis of the neural tube in a progenitor domain- specific fashion along the dorsoventral axis. Maintains quiescence of neural stem cells and plays a role as a fate determinant that segregates asymmetrically to one daughter cell during neural stem cells mitosis, resulting in neuronal differentiation in Dll1-inheriting cell. Plays a role in immune systeme development, namely the development of all T-cells and marginal zone (MZ) B-cells (By similarity). Blocks the differentiation of progenitor cells into the B-cell lineage while promoting the emergence of a population of cells with the characteristics of a T-cell/NK-cell precursor (PubMed:11581320). Also plays a role during muscle development. During early development, inhibits myoblasts differentiation from the medial dermomyotomal lip and later regulates progenitor cell differentiation. Directly modulates cell adhesion and basal lamina formation in satellite cells through Notch signaling. Maintains myogenic progenitors pool by suppressing differentiation through down-regulation of MYOD1 and is required for satellite cell homing and PAX7 expression. During craniofacial and trunk myogenesis suppresses differentiation of cranial mesoderm-derived and somite-derived muscle via MYOD1 regulation but in cranial mesoderm- derived progenitors, is neither required for satellite cell homing nor for PAX7 expression. Also plays a role during pancreatic cell development. During type B pancreatic cell development, may be involved in the initiation of proximodistal patterning in the early pancreatic epithelium. Stimulates multipotent pancreatic progenitor cells proliferation and pancreatic growth by maintaining HES1 expression and PTF1A protein levels. During fetal stages of development, is required to maintain arterial identity and the responsiveness of arterial endothelial cells for VEGFA through regulation of KDR activation and NRP1 expression. Controls sprouting angiogenesis and subsequent vertical branch formation througth regulation on tip cell differentiation. Negatively regulates goblet cell differentiation in intestine and controls secretory fat commitment through lateral inhibition in small intestine. Plays a role during inner ear development; negatively regulates auditory hair cell differentiation. Plays a role during nephron development through Notch signaling pathway.

This may affect gene expression and function in a number of ways that include mRNA translation by changing codons and hence the amino acid sequence of proteins since the translational machinery read the inosine as a guanosine; pre-mRNA splicing by altering splice site recognition sequences; RNA stability by changing sequences involved in nuclease recognition; genetic stability in the case of RNA virus genomes by changing sequences during viral RNA replication; and RNA structure- dependent activities such as microRNA production or targeting or protein-RNA interactions. Can edit both viral and cellular RNAs and can edit RNAs at multiple sites (hyper-editing) or at specific sites (site- specific editing). Its cellular RNA substrates include: bladder cancer- associated protein (BLCAP), neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate (GRIA2) and serotonin (HTR2C) and GABA receptor (GABRA3). Site-specific RNA editing of transcripts encoding these proteins results in amino acid substitutions which consequently alters their functional activities. Exhibits low-level editing at the GRIA2 Q/R site, but edits efficiently at the R/G site and HOTSPOT1. Its viral RNA substrates include: hepatitis C virus (HCV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), measles virus (MV), hepatitis delta virus (HDV), and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Exhibits either a proviral (HDV, MV, VSV and HIV-1) or an antiviral effect (HCV) and this can be editing-dependent (HDV and HCV), editing-independent (VSV and MV) or both (HIV-1). Impairs HCV replication via RNA editing at multiple sites. Enhances the replication of MV, VSV and HIV-1 through an editing-independent mechanism via suppression of EIF2AK2/PKR activation and function. Stimulates both the release and infectivity of HIV-1 viral particles by an editing-dependent mechanism where it associates with viral RNAs and edits adenosines in the 5'UTR and the Rev and Tat coding sequence. Can enhance viral replication of HDV via A-to-I editing at a site designated as amber/W, thereby changing an UAG amber stop codon to an UIG tryptophan (W) codon that permits synthesis of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg) which has a key role in the assembly of viral particles.

Has a role in several intracellular trafficking events. Functions in insulin signaling and secretion. Required for translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and glucose uptake in response to insulin-mediated RHOQ activation. Regulates insulin secretion through two different mechanisms: involved in glucose-induced insulin secretion downstream of insulin receptor in a pathway that involves AKT1 activation and TBC1D4/AS160 phosphorylation, and participates in the late step of insulin granule exocytosis probably in insulin granule fusion. Synthesizes PtdIns3P in response to insulin signaling. Functions in clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle formation and distribution. Regulates dynamin-independent endocytosis, probably by recruiting EEA1 to internalizing vesicles. In neurosecretory cells synthesizes PtdIns3P on large dense core vesicles. Participates in calcium induced contraction of vascular smooth muscle by regulating myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation through a mechanism involving Rho kinase-dependent phosphorylation of the MLCP-regulatory subunit MYPT1. May play a role in the EGF signaling cascade. May be involved in mitosis and UV-induced damage response. Required for maintenance of normal renal structure and function by supporting normal podocyte function.

Catalyzes phosphorylation of STAT3 at 'Tyr-705' and histone H3 at 'Thr- 11' (H3T11ph), leading to activate transcription (PubMed:22306293, PubMed:22901803, PubMed:24120661). Its ability to activate transcription plays a role in cancer cells by promoting cell proliferation and promote tumorigenesis (PubMed:18337823, PubMed:22901803, PubMed:26787900). Promotes the expression of the immune checkpoint protein CD274 in ARNTL/BMAL1-deficient macrophages (By similarity). May also act as a translation regulator for a subset of mRNAs, independently of its pyruvate kinase activity: associates with subpools of endoplasmic reticulum-associated ribosomes, binds directly to the mRNAs translated at the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes translation of these endoplasmic reticulum-destined mRNAs (By similarity). Plays a role in caspase independent cell death of tumor cells (PubMed:17308100). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P52480, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17308100, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18191611, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18337823, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20847263, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21620138, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22056988, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22306293, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22901803, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24120661, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26787900}.

The DCX(AMBRA1) complex specifically mediates the polyubiquitination of target proteins such as BECN1, ND1, ND2, ND3, ELOC and ULK1 (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). Acts as an upstream master regulator of the transition from G1 to S cell phase: AMBRA1 specifically recognizes and binds phosphorylated cyclin-D (ND1, ND2 and ND3), leading to cyclin-D ubiquitination by the DCX(AMBRA1) complex and subsequent degradation (PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). By controlling the transition from G1 to S phase and cyclin-D degradation, AMBRA1 acts as a tumor suppressor that promotes genomic integrity during DNA replication and counteracts developmental abnormalities and tumor growth (PubMed:33854232, PubMed:33854235, PubMed:33854239). AMBRA1 also regulates the cell cycle by promoting MYC dephosphorylation and degradation independently of the DCX(AMBRA1) complex: acts via interaction with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PPP2CA), which enhances interaction between PPP2CA and MYC, leading to MYC dephosphorylation and degradation (PubMed:25803737, PubMed:25438055). Acts as a regulator of Cul5-RING (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin- protein ligase complexes by mediating ubiquitination and degradation of Elongin-C (ELOC) component of CRL5 complexes (PubMed:25499913, PubMed:30166453). Acts as a key regulator of autophagy by modulating the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex: controls protein turnover during neuronal development, and regulates normal cell survival and proliferation (PubMed:21358617). In normal conditions, AMBRA1 is tethered to the cytoskeleton via interaction with dyneins DYNLL1 and DYNLL2 (PubMed:20921139). Upon autophagy induction, AMBRA1 is released from the cytoskeletal docking site to induce autophagosome nucleation by mediating ubiquitination of proteins involved in autophagy (PubMed:20921139). The DCX(AMBRA1) complex mediates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, increasing the association between BECN1 and PIK3C3 to promote PIK3C3 activity (By similarity). In collaboration with TRAF6, AMBRA1 mediates 'Lys-63'-linked ubiquitination of ULK1 following autophagy induction, promoting ULK1 stability and kinase activity (PubMed:23524951). Also activates ULK1 via interaction with TRIM32: TRIM32 stimulates ULK1 through unanchored 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitin chains (PubMed:31123703). Also acts as an activator of mitophagy via interaction with PRKN and LC3 proteins (MAP1LC3A, MAP1LC3B or MAP1LC3C); possibly by bringing damaged mitochondria onto autophagosomes (PubMed:21753002, PubMed:25215947). Also activates mitophagy by acting as a cofactor for HUWE1; acts by promoting HUWE1- mediated ubiquitination of MFN2 (PubMed:30217973). AMBRA1 is also involved in regulatory T-cells (Treg) differentiation by promoting FOXO3 dephosphorylation independently of the DCX(AMBRA1) complex: acts via interaction with PPP2CA, which enhances interaction between PPP2CA and FOXO3, leading to FOXO3 dephosphorylation and stabilization (PubMed:30513302). May act as a regulator of intracellular trafficking, regulating the localization of active PTK2/FAK and SRC (By similarity).

Plays a role as coinhibitory receptor in immune response, insulin action and functions also as an activator during angiogenesis (PubMed:18424730, PubMed:23696226, PubMed:25363763). Its coinhibitory receptor function is phosphorylation- and PTPN6 -dependent, which in turn, suppress signal transduction of associated receptors by dephosphorylation of their downstream effectors. Plays a role in immune response, of T cells, natural killer (NK) and neutrophils (PubMed:18424730, PubMed:23696226). Upon TCR/CD3 complex stimulation, inhibits TCR- mediated cytotoxicity by blocking granule exocytosis by mediating homophilic binding to adjacent cells, allowing interaction with and phosphorylation by LCK and interaction with the TCR/CD3 complex which recruits PTPN6 resulting in dephosphorylation of CD247 and ZAP70 (PubMed:18424730). Also inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production through inhibition of JNK cascade and plays a crucial role in regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting T cell through its interaction with HAVCR2 (PubMed:25363763). Upon natural killer (NK) cells activation, inhibit KLRK1-mediated cytolysis of CEACAM1-bearing tumor cells by trans-homophilic interactions with CEACAM1 on the target cell and lead to cis-interaction between CEACAM1 and KLRK1, allowing PTPN6 recruitment and then VAV1 dephosphorylation (PubMed:23696226). Upon neutrophils activation negatively regulates IL1B production by recruiting PTPN6 to a SYK-TLR4-CEACAM1 complex, that dephosphorylates SYK, reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lysosome disruption, which in turn, reduces the activity of the inflammasome. Down-regulates neutrophil production by acting as a coinhibitory receptor for CSF3R by down-regulating the CSF3R-STAT3 pathway through recruitment of PTPN6 that dephosphorylates CSF3R (By similarity). Also regulates insulin action by promoting INS clearance and regulating lipogenesis in liver through regulating insulin signaling (By similarity). Upon INS stimulation, undergoes phosphorylation by INSR leading to INS clearance by increasing receptor-mediated insulin endocytosis. This inernalization promotes interaction with FASN leading to receptor-mediated insulin degradation and to reduction of FASN activity leading to negative regulation of fatty acid synthesis. INSR-mediated phosphorylation also provokes a down-regulation of cell proliferation through SHC1 interaction resulting in decrease coupling of SHC1 to the MAPK3/ERK1-MAPK1/ERK2 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (By similarity). Functions as activator in angiogenesis by promoting blood vessel remodeling through endothelial cell differentiation and migration and in arteriogenesis by increasing the number of collateral arteries and collateral vessel calibers after ischemia. Also regulates vascular permeability through the VEGFR2 signaling pathway resulting in control of nitric oxide production (By similarity). Down-regulates cell growth in response to EGF through its interaction with SHC1 that mediates interaction with EGFR resulting in decrease coupling of SHC1 to the MAPK3/ERK1- MAPK1/ERK2 pathway (By similarity). Negatively regulates platelet aggregation by decreasing platelet adhesion on type I collagen through the GPVI-FcRgamma complex (By similarity).

Uses ATP and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PubMed:15135396, PubMed:28676499). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain- containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Participates in cellular signaling in response to various growth factors. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by receptor tyrosine kinases ligands such as EGF, insulin, IGF1, VEGFA and PDGF. Involved in signaling via insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. Essential in endothelial cell migration during vascular development through VEGFA signaling, possibly by regulating RhoA activity. Required for lymphatic vasculature development, possibly by binding to RAS and by activation by EGF and FGF2, but not by PDGF. Regulates invadopodia formation through the PDPK1-AKT1 pathway. Participates in cardiomyogenesis in embryonic stem cells through a AKT1 pathway. Participates in vasculogenesis in embryonic stem cells through PDK1 and protein kinase C pathway. In addition to its lipid kinase activity, it displays a serine-protein kinase activity that results in the autophosphorylation of the p85alpha regulatory subunit as well as phosphorylation of other proteins such as 4EBP1, H-Ras, the IL-3 beta c receptor and possibly others (PubMed:23936502, PubMed:28676499).

        "description": "FUNCTION: AKT1 is one of 3 closely related serine/threonine-protein kinases (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) called the AKT kinase, and which regulate many processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, growth and angiogenesis (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:15526160, PubMed:11882383, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:21432781). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT regulates also the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT regulates also cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the TORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915). Also regulates the TORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 (PubMed:33594058). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3- 3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser- 319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth. AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF-I (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174, PubMed:20231902). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P31750, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P47196, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10358075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10576742, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10926925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154276, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11994271, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150915, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12176338, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12964941, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16139227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16982699, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17726016, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18507042, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19592491, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19934221, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20086174, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20231902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20471940, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20682768, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23431171, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32228865, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32322062, ECO:0000269|PubMed:33594058, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9829964, ECO:0000303|PubMed:11882383, ECO:0000303|PubMed:15526160, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21432781, ECO:0000303|PubMed:21620960}.",

Release into the cytoplasm is mediated upon binding to poly-ADP-ribose chains (By similarity).

Can modulate chromatin function through deacetylation of histones and can promote alterations in the methylation of histones and DNA, leading to transcriptional repression (PubMed:15469825). Deacetylates a broad range of transcription factors and coregulators, thereby regulating target gene expression positively and negatively (PubMed:15152190, PubMed:14980222, PubMed:14976264). Serves as a sensor of the cytosolic ratio of NAD(+)/NADH which is altered by glucose deprivation and metabolic changes associated with caloric restriction (PubMed:15205477).

Component of the eNoSC (energy-dependent nucleolar silencing) complex, a complex that mediates silencing of rDNA in response to intracellular energy status and acts by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes (PubMed:18485871). The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus (PubMed:18485871, PubMed:21504832).

Involved in NR0B2/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling: Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2/SHP thereby stimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading to transcriptional repression (PubMed:20375098). Proposed to contribute to genomic integrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however, reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin are conflicting (By similarity). Proposed to play a role in constitutive heterochromatin (CH) formation and/or maintenance through regulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1 (PubMed:15469825, PubMed:18004385). Upon oxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2 (PubMed:18004385, PubMed:21504832). This increase in SUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turn seems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin which correlates with greater genomic integrity during stress response (PubMed:18004385, PubMed:21504832).

Deacetylates FOXO1 resulting in its nuclear retention and enhancement of its transcriptional activity leading to increased gluconeogenesis in liver (PubMed:15692560).

Involved in lipid metabolism: deacetylates LPIN1, thereby inhibiting diacylglycerol synthesis (PubMed:20817729, PubMed:29765047). Implicated in regulation of adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1 and SMRT/NCOR2 (By similarity). Deacetylates p300/EP300 and PRMT1 (By similarity). Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, and HMGCS1 deacetylation (PubMed:21701047). Involved in liver and muscle metabolism.

Promotes DNA double-strand breaks by mediating deacetylation of SIRT6 (PubMed:32538779). Transcriptional suppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressor complex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptional suppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. Deacetylates WRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities and regulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage (PubMed:18203716).

Increases p53/TP53-mediated transcription- independent apoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. Deacetylates XR6/Ku70 at 'Lys-539' and 'Lys-542' causing it to sequester BAX away from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptosis.

During the neurogenic transition, represses selective NOTCH1-target genes through histone deacetylation in a BCL6-dependent manner and leading to neuronal differentiation. Regulates the circadian expression of several core clock genes, including ARNTL/BMAL1, RORC, PER2 and CRY1 and plays a critical role in maintaining a controlled rhythmicity in histone acetylation, thereby contributing to circadian chromatin remodeling (PubMed:18662546).

Rabs cycle between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form that is able to recruit to membranes different sets of downstream effectors directly responsible for vesicle formation, movement, tethering and fusion. That Rab is involved in endocytic recycling and regulates the transport to the plasma membrane of transmembrane proteins like the tight junction protein OCLN/occludin. Thereby, it regulates the assembly and the activity of tight junctions. Moreover, it may also regulate tight junction assembly by activating the PKA signaling pathway and by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton through the activation of the downstream effectors PRKACA and MICALL2 respectively. Through its role in tight junction assembly, may play a role in the establishment of Sertoli cell barrier. Plays also a role in angiogenesis through regulation of endothelial cells chemotaxis. Also involved in neurite outgrowth. Has also been proposed to play a role in post-Golgi membrane trafficking from the TGN to the recycling endosome.

Regulates protein synthesis by controlling the activity of initiation factor 2B (EIF2BE/EIF2B5) in the same manner as glycogen synthase (PubMed:8397507). In Wnt signaling, GSK3B forms a multimeric complex with APC, AXIN1 and CTNNB1/beta-catenin and phosphorylates the N-terminus of CTNNB1 leading to its degradation mediated by ubiquitin/proteasomes (PubMed:12554650). Phosphorylates JUN at sites proximal to its DNA-binding domain, thereby reducing its affinity for DNA (PubMed:1846781).

        "description": "FUNCTION: Serine/threonine kinase which acts as an essential component of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. MAPK14 is one of the four p38 MAPKs which play an important role in the cascades of cellular responses evoked by extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress leading to direct activation of transcription factors. Accordingly, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate a broad range of proteins and it has been estimated that they may have approximately 200 to 300 substrates each. Some of the targets are downstream kinases which are activated through phosphorylation and further phosphorylate additional targets. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 can directly phosphorylate and activate transcription factors such as CREB1, ATF1, the NF-kappa-B isoform RELA/NFKB3, STAT1 and STAT3, but can also phosphorylate histone H3 and the nucleosomal protein HMGN1. RPS6KA5/MSK1 and RPS6KA4/MSK2 play important roles in the rapid induction of immediate-early genes in response to stress or mitogenic stimuli, either by inducing chromatin remodeling or by recruiting the transcription machinery. On the other hand, two other kinase targets, MAPKAPK2/MK2 and MAPKAPK3/MK3, participate in the control of gene expression mostly at the post-transcriptional level, by phosphorylating ZFP36 (tristetraprolin) and ELAVL1, and by regulating EEF2K, which is important for the elongation of mRNA during translation. MKNK1/MNK1 and MKNK2/MNK2, two other kinases activated by p38 MAPKs, regulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the initiation factor EIF4E2. MAPK14 interacts also with casein kinase II, leading to its activation through autophosphorylation and further phosphorylation of TP53/p53. In the cytoplasm, the p38 MAPK pathway is an important regulator of protein turnover. For example, CFLAR is an inhibitor of TNF-induced apoptosis whose proteasome-mediated degradation is regulated by p38 MAPK phosphorylation. In a similar way, MAPK14 phosphorylates the ubiquitin ligase SIAH2, regulating its activity towards EGLN3. MAPK14 may also inhibit the lysosomal degradation pathway of autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of the transmembrane protein ATG9. Another function of MAPK14 is to regulate the endocytosis of membrane receptors by different mechanisms that impinge on the small GTPase RAB5A. In addition, clathrin-mediated EGFR internalization induced by inflammatory cytokines and UV irradiation depends on MAPK14-mediated phosphorylation of EGFR itself as well as of RAB5A effectors. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins is regulated by p38 MAPKs as well. In response to inflammatory stimuli, p38 MAPKs phosphorylate the membrane-associated metalloprotease ADAM17. Such phosphorylation is required for ADAM17-mediated ectodomain shedding of TGF-alpha family ligands, which results in the activation of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. Another p38 MAPK substrate is FGFR1. FGFR1 can be translocated from the extracellular space into the cytosol and nucleus of target cells, and regulates processes such as rRNA synthesis and cell growth. FGFR1 translocation requires p38 MAPK activation. In the nucleus, many transcription factors are phosphorylated and activated by p38 MAPKs in response to different stimuli. Classical examples include ATF1, ATF2, ATF6, ELK1, PTPRH, DDIT3, TP53/p53 and MEF2C and MEF2A. The p38 MAPKs are emerging as important modulators of gene expression by regulating chromatin modifiers and remodelers. The promoters of several genes involved in the inflammatory response, such as IL6, IL8 and IL12B, display a p38 MAPK-dependent enrichment of histone H3 phosphorylation on 'Ser-10' (H3S10ph) in LPS-stimulated myeloid cells. This phosphorylation enhances the accessibility of the cryptic NF- kappa-B-binding sites marking promoters for increased NF-kappa-B recruitment. Phosphorylates CDC25B and CDC25C which is required for binding to 14-3-3 proteins and leads to initiation of a G2 delay after ultraviolet radiation. Phosphorylates TIAR following DNA damage, releasing TIAR from GADD45A mRNA and preventing mRNA degradation. The p38 MAPKs may also have kinase-independent roles, which are thought to be due to the binding to targets in the absence of phosphorylation. Protein O-Glc-N-acylation catalyzed by the OGT is regulated by MAPK14, and, although OGT does not seem to be phosphorylated by MAPK14, their interaction increases upon MAPK14 activation induced by glucose deprivation. This interaction may regulate OGT activity by recruiting it to specific targets such as neurofilament H, stimulating its O-Glc- N-acylation. Required in mid-fetal development for the growth of embryo-derived blood vessels in the labyrinth layer of the placenta. Also plays an essential role in developmental and stress-induced erythropoiesis, through regulation of EPO gene expression. Isoform MXI2 activation is stimulated by mitogens and oxidative stress and only poorly phosphorylates ELK1 and ATF2. Isoform EXIP may play a role in the early onset of apoptosis. Phosphorylates S100A9 at 'Thr-113'. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10330143, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10747897, ECO:0000269|PubMed:10943842, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11154262, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11333986, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15905572, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16932740, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17003045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17724032, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19893488, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20188673, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20932473, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9430721, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9687510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9792677, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9858528}.

Growth factor-stimulated mTORC1 activation involves a AKT1-mediated phosphorylation of TSC1- TSC2, which leads to the activation of the RHEB GTPase that potently activates the protein kinase activity of mTORC1. Amino acid-signaling to mTORC1 requires its relocalization to the lysosomes mediated by the Ragulator complex and the Rag GTPases. Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis. mTORC1 phosphorylates EIF4EBP1 and releases it from inhibiting the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E). mTORC1 phosphorylates and activates S6K1 at 'Thr-389', which then promotes protein synthesis by phosphorylating PDCD4 and targeting it for degradation.

        "description": "FUNCTION: Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol derivatives at position 3 of the inositol ring to produce 3-phosphoinositides (PubMed:15135396). Uses ATP and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (PubMed:15135396). PIP3 plays a key role by recruiting PH domain-containing proteins to the membrane, including AKT1 and PDPK1, activating signaling cascades involved in cell growth, survival, proliferation, motility and morphology. Involved in the activation of AKT1 upon stimulation by G- protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) ligands such as CXCL12, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and lysophosphatidic acid. May also act downstream receptor tyrosine kinases. Required in different signaling pathways for stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. Plays a role in platelet activation signaling triggered by GPCRs, alpha-IIb/beta-3 integrins (ITGA2B/ ITGB3) and ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif)-bearing receptors such as GP6. Regulates the strength of adhesion of ITGA2B/ ITGB3 activated receptors necessary for the cellular transmission of contractile forces. Required for platelet aggregation induced by F2 (thrombin) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2). Has a role in cell survival. May have a role in cell migration. Involved in the early stage of autophagosome formation. Modulates the intracellular level of PtdIns3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) and activates PIK3C3 kinase activity. May act as a scaffold, independently of its lipid kinase activity to positively regulate autophagy. May have a role in insulin signaling as scaffolding protein in which the lipid kinase activity is not required. May have a kinase-independent function in regulating cell proliferation and in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Mediator of oncogenic signal in cell lines lacking PTEN.

MTOR directly or indirectly regulates the phosphorylation of at least 800 proteins. Functions as part of 2 structurally and functionally distinct signaling complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 1 and 2) (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:21576368, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429704). Activated mTORC1 up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation and ribosome synthesis (PubMed:12087098, PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12150926, PubMed:12231510, PubMed:12718876, PubMed:14651849, PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718, PubMed:15545625, PubMed:15718470, PubMed:18497260, PubMed:18762023, PubMed:18925875, PubMed:20516213, PubMed:20537536, PubMed:21659604, PubMed:23429703, PubMed:23429704, PubMed:25799227, PubMed:26018084). This includes phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1 and release of its inhibition toward the elongation initiation factor 4E (eiF4E) (By similarity). Moreover, phosphorylates and activates RPS6KB1 and RPS6KB2 that promote protein synthesis by modulating the activity of their downstream targets including ribosomal protein S6, eukaryotic translation initiation factor EIF4B, and the inhibitor of translation initiation PDCD4 (PubMed:12150925, PubMed:12087098, PubMed:18925875). This also includes mTORC1 signaling cascade controlling the MiT/TFE factors TFEB and TFE3: in the presence of nutrients, mediates phosphorylation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their cytosolic retention and inactivation (PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22692423). Upon starvation or lysosomal stress, inhibition of mTORC1 induces dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB and TFE3, promoting their transcription factor activity (PubMed:22576015, PubMed:22343943, PubMed:22692423). Stimulates the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, both by acute regulation through RPS6KB1-mediated phosphorylation of the biosynthetic enzyme CAD, and delayed regulation, through transcriptional enhancement of the pentose phosphate pathway which produces 5-phosphoribosyl-1- pyrophosphate (PRPP), an allosteric activator of CAD at a later step in synthesis, this function is dependent on the mTORC1 complex (PubMed:23429704, PubMed:23429703). Regulates ribosome synthesis by activating RNA polymerase III-dependent transcription through phosphorylation and inhibition of MAF1 an RNA polymerase III-repressor (PubMed:20516213). In parallel to protein synthesis, also regulates lipid synthesis through SREBF1/SREBP1 and LPIN1 (By similarity). To maintain energy homeostasis mTORC1 may also regulate mitochondrial biogenesis through regulation of PPARGC1A (By similarity). mTORC1 also negatively regulates autophagy through phosphorylation of ULK1 (By similarity). Under nutrient sufficiency, phosphorylates ULK1 at 'Ser- 758', disrupting the interaction with AMPK and preventing activation of ULK1 (By similarity). Also prevents autophagy through phosphorylation of the autophagy inhibitor DAP (PubMed:20537536). Also prevents autophagy by phosphorylating RUBCNL/Pacer under nutrient-rich conditions (PubMed:30704899). Prevents autophagy by mediating phosphorylation of AMBRA1, thereby inhibiting AMBRA1 ability to mediate ubiquitination of ULK1 and interaction between AMBRA1 and PPP2CA (PubMed:23524951, PubMed:25438055). mTORC1 exerts a feedback control on upstream growth factor signaling that includes phosphorylation and activation of GRB10 a INSR-dependent signaling suppressor (PubMed:21659604). Among other potential targets mTORC1 may phosphorylate CLIP1 and regulate microtubules (PubMed:12231510). As part of the mTORC2 complex MTOR may regulate other cellular processes including survival and organization of the cytoskeleton (PubMed:15268862, PubMed:15467718). Plays a critical role in the phosphorylation at 'Ser-473' of AKT1, a pro-survival effector of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, facilitating its activation by PDK1 (PubMed:15718470). mTORC2 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton, through phosphorylation of PRKCA, PXN and activation of the Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factors RHOA and RAC1A or RAC1B (PubMed:15268862). mTORC2 also regulates the phosphorylation of SGK1 at 'Ser-422' (PubMed:18925875). Regulates osteoclastogenesis by adjusting the expression of CEBPB isoforms (By similarity). Plays an important regulatory role in the circadian clock function; regulates period length and rhythm amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and liver clocks (By similarity). Phosphorylates SQSTM1, promoting interaction between SQSTM1 and KEAP1 and subsequent inactivation of the BCR(KEAP1) complex (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P42346, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:Q9JLN9, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12087098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12150926, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12231510, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12718876, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14651849, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15268862, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15467718, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15545625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15718470, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18497260, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18762023, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18925875, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20516213, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20537536, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21576368, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21659604, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22343943, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22576015, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22692423, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429703, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23429704, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23524951, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25438055, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25799227, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26018084, ECO:0000269|PubMed:30704899}.",

The phosphorylation of EPRS1, induced by interferon-gamma, dissociates the protein from the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase multienzyme complex and recruits it to the GAIT complex that binds to stem loop-containing GAIT elements in the 3'-UTR of diverse inflammatory mRNAs (such as ceruplasmin), suppressing their translation. Interferon-gamma can therefore redirect, in specific cells, the EPRS1 function from protein synthesis to translation inhibition (PubMed:15479637, PubMed:23071094).

Isoform p66Shc does not mediate Ras activation, but is involved in signal transduction pathways that regulate the cellular response to oxidative stress and life span. Isoform p66Shc acts as a downstream target of the tumor suppressor p53 and is indispensable for the ability of stress-activated p53 to induce elevation of intracellular oxidants, cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The expression of isoform p66Shc has been correlated with life span (By similarity). Participates in signaling downstream of the angiopoietin receptor TEK/TIE2, and plays a role in the regulation of endothelial cell migration and sprouting angiogenesis. {ECO:0000250, ECO:0000269|PubMed:14665640}.",

Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events (PubMed:10220385). Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes (PubMed:10220385). In addition to histones, deacetylates other proteins: plays a central role in microtubule-dependent cell motility by mediating deacetylation of tubulin (PubMed:12024216, PubMed:20308065). Required for cilia disassembly; via deacetylation of alpha-tubulin (PubMed:17604723).

Involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetic regulation of ESR1 expression in breast cancer (PubMed:24413532). In addition to its protein deacetylase activity, plays a key role in the degradation of misfolded proteins: when misfolded proteins are too abundant to be degraded by the chaperone refolding system and the ubiquitin-proteasome, mediates the transport of misfolded proteins to a cytoplasmic juxtanuclear structure called aggresome (PubMed:17846173).

In the hypothalamus, acts as an appetite-regulating factor that induces a decrease in food intake and an increase in energy consumption by inducing anorexinogenic factors and suppressing orexigenic neuropeptides, also regulates bone mass and secretion of hypothalamo- pituitary-adrenal hormones. In the periphery, increases basal metabolism, influences reproductive function, regulates pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin secretion, is pro-angiogenic for endothelial cell and affects innate and adaptive immunity (By similarity) (PubMed:8589726, PubMed:11460888, PubMed:19688109, PubMed:24340098, PubMed:25060689).

In addition to its known satiety inducing effect, has a modulatory role in nutrient absorption. In the intestine, reduces glucose absorption by enterocytes by activating PKC and leading to a sequential activation of p38, PI3K and ERK signaling pathways which exerts an inhibitory effect on glucose absorption (PubMed:24340098).

May also play an apoptotic role via JAK2-STAT3 pathway and up-regulation of BIRC5 expression (PubMed:18242580). Pro-angiogenic, has mitogenic activity on vascular endothelial cells and plays a role in matrix remodeling by regulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (PubMed:11460888).

Plays a pro-inflammatory role, in synergy with IL1B, by inducing NOS2 wich promotes the production of IL6, IL8 and Prostaglandin E2, through a signaling pathway that involves JAK2, PI3K, MAP2K1/MEK1 and MAPK14/p38 (PubMed:15899045, PubMed:19688109). In adaptive immunity, promotes the switch of memory T-cells towards T helper-1 cell immune responses (By similarity). Increases CD4(+)CD25(-) T-cell proliferation and reduces autophagy during TCR (T-cell receptor) stimulation, through MTOR signaling pathway activation and BCL2 up-regulation (PubMed:25060689). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P41160, ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P50596, ECO:0000269|PubMed:11460888, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12504075, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15899045, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17344214, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18242580, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19688109, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24340098, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25060689, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8589726, ECO:0000305|PubMed:15122202, ECO:0000305|PubMed:25232147}.",

        "description": "FUNCTION: Atypical chemokine receptor that controls chemokine levels and localization via high-affinity chemokine binding that is uncoupled from classic ligand-driven signal transduction cascades, resulting instead in chemokine sequestration, degradation, or transcytosis. Also known as interceptor (internalizing receptor) or chemokine-scavenging receptor or chemokine decoy receptor. Acts as a receptor for chemokines CXCL11 and CXCL12/SDF1 (PubMed:16107333, PubMed:19255243, PubMed:19380869, PubMed:20161793, PubMed:22300987). Chemokine binding does not activate G-protein-mediated signal transduction but instead induces beta-arrestin recruitment, leading to ligand internalization and activation of MAPK signaling pathway (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:18653785, PubMed:20018651). Required for regulation of CXCR4 protein levels in migrating interneurons, thereby adapting their chemokine responsiveness (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:18653785). In glioma cells, transduces signals via MEK/ERK pathway, mediating resistance to apoptosis. Promotes cell growth and survival (PubMed:16940167, PubMed:20388803). Not involved in cell migration, adhesion or proliferation of normal hematopoietic progenitors but activated by CXCL11 in malignant hemapoietic cells, leading to phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (MAPK3/MAPK1) and enhanced cell adhesion and migration (PubMed:17804806, PubMed:18653785, PubMed:19641136, PubMed:20887389). Plays a regulatory role in CXCR4-mediated activation of cell surface integrins by CXCL12 (PubMed:18653785). Required for heart valve development (PubMed:17804806).

Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment in macrophages, or following mitogenic stimuli, functions downstream of PI3K to activate MAP2K1/MEK1-MAPK1/ERK2 signaling cascade independently of RAF1 activation. Required for insulin-dependent activation of AKT3, but may function as an adapter rather than a direct activator. Upon insulin treatment may act as a downstream effector of PI3K and contribute to the activation of translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 and subsequent glucose transport in adipocytes. In EGF-induced cells, binds and activates MAP2K5/MEK5- MAPK7/ERK5 independently of its kinase activity and can activate JUN promoter through MEF2C. Through binding with SQSTM1/p62, functions in interleukin-1 signaling and activation of NF-kappa-B with the specific adapters RIPK1 and TRAF6. Participates in TNF-dependent transactivation of NF-kappa-B by phosphorylating and activating IKBKB kinase, which in turn leads to the degradation of NF-kappa-B inhibitors. In migrating astrocytes, forms a cytoplasmic complex with PARD6A and is recruited by CDC42 to function in the establishment of cell polarity along with the microtubule motor and dynein. In association with FEZ1, stimulates neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. In the inflammatory response, is required for the T-helper 2 (Th2) differentiation process, including interleukin production, efficient activation of JAK1 and the subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6. May be involved in development of allergic airway inflammation (asthma), a process dependent on Th2 immune response. In the NF-kappa-B-mediated inflammatory response, can relieve SETD6-dependent repression of NF- kappa-B target genes by phosphorylating the RELA subunit at 'Ser-311'.

        "description": "FUNCTION: Is believed to be a multifunctional and multicompartmental protein involved in inflammation and infection processes, ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis in mitochondria, regulation of apoptosis, transcriptional regulation and pre-mRNA splicing. At the cell surface is thought to act as an endothelial receptor for plasma proteins of the complement and kallikrein-kinin cascades. Putative receptor for C1q; specifically binds to the globular 'heads' of C1q thus inhibiting C1; may perform the receptor function through a complex with C1qR/CD93. In complex with cytokeratin-1/KRT1 is a high affinity receptor for kininogen-1/HMWK. Can also bind other plasma proteins, such as coagulation factor XII leading to its autoactivation. May function to bind initially fluid kininogen-1 to the cell membrane. The secreted form may enhance both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. It is postulated that the cell surface form requires docking with transmembrane proteins for downstream signaling which might be specific for a cell-type or response. By acting as C1q receptor is involved in chemotaxis of immature dendritic cells and neutrophils and is proposed to signal through CD209/DC-SIGN on immature dendritic cells, through integrin alpha-4/beta-1 during trophoblast invasion of the decidua, and through integrin beta-1 during endothelial cell adhesion and spreading. Signaling involved in inhibition of innate immune response is implicating the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway. Required for protein synthesis in mitochondria (PubMed:28942965). In mitochondrial translation may be involved in formation of functional 55S mitoribosomes; the function seems to involve its RNA-binding activity. May be involved in the nucleolar ribosome maturation process; the function may involve the exchange of FBL for RRP1 in the association with pre-ribosome particles. Involved in regulation of RNA splicing by inhibiting the RNA-binding capacity of SRSF1 and its phosphorylation. Is required for the nuclear translocation of splicing factor U2AF1L4. Involved in regulation of CDKN2A- and HRK-mediated apoptosis. Stabilizes mitochondrial CDKN2A isoform smARF. May be involved in regulation of FOXC1 transcriptional activity and NFY/AAT-binding factor complex- mediated transcription. May play a role in antibacterial defense as it can bind to cell surface hyaluronan and inhibit Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase. May be involved in modulation of the immune response; ligation by HCV core protein is resulting in suppression of interleukin-12 production in monocyte-derived dendritic cells.

Tumor suppressor, the lipid phosphatase activity is critical for its tumor suppressor function (PubMed:9187108, PubMed:9616126, PubMed:9811831). Antagonizes the PI3K-AKT/PKB signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides and thereby modulating cell cycle progression and cell survival (By similarity). The unphosphorylated form cooperates with MAGI2 to suppress AKT1 activation (PubMed:11707428). In motile cells, suppresses the formation of lateral pseudopods and thereby promotes cell polarization and directed movement (PubMed:22279049). Dephosphorylates tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase and inhibits cell migration and integrin-mediated cell spreading and focal adhesion formation (PubMed:22279049). Plays a role as a key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Involved in the regulation of synaptic function in excitatory hippocampal synapses. Recruited to the postsynaptic membrane upon NMDA receptor activation, is required for the modulation of synaptic activity during plasticity. Enhancement of lipid phosphatase activity is able to drive depression of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic responses, activity required for NMDA receptor-dependent long-term depression (LTD) (By similarity).

Histone deacetylation gives a tag for epigenetic repression and plays an important role in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle progression and developmental events. Histone deacetylases act via the formation of large multiprotein complexes. Involved in muscle maturation by repressing transcription of myocyte enhancer MEF2C. During muscle differentiation, it shuttles into the cytoplasm, allowing the expression of myocyte enhancer factors. Involved in the MTA1-mediated epigenetic regulation of ESR1 expression in breast cancer. Serves as a corepressor of RARA and causes its deacetylation (PubMed:28167758). In association with RARA, plays a role in the repression of microRNA-10a and thereby in the inflammatory response (PubMed:28167758). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:24413532, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28167758}.",

It is potent pyrogen causing fever by direct action or by stimulation of interleukin-1 secretion and is implicated in the induction of cachexia, Under certain conditions it can stimulate cell proliferation and induce cell differentiation. Impairs regulatory T- cells (Treg) function in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis via FOXP3 dephosphorylation. Up-regulates the expression of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which dephosphorylates the key 'Ser-418' residue of FOXP3, thereby inactivating FOXP3 and rendering Treg cells functionally defective (PubMed:23396208). Key mediator of cell death in the anticancer action of BCG-stimulated neutrophils in combination with DIABLO/SMAC mimetic in the RT4v6 bladder cancer cell line (PubMed:22517918, PubMed:16829952, PubMed:23396208). Induces insulin resistance in adipocytes via inhibition of insulin-induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and insulin-induced glucose uptake. Induces GKAP42 protein degradation in adipocytes which is partially responsible for TNF-induced insulin resistance (By similarity).

Like ABCD1 seems to have fatty acyl-CoA thioesterase (ACOT) and ATPase activities, according to this model, VLCFA-CoA as free VLCFA is transpoted in an ATP-dependent manner into peroxisomes after the hydrolysis of VLCFA-CoA mediated by the ACOT activity of ABCD2 (Probable) (PubMed:29397936).

Regulates a signal transduction pathway linking plasma membrane receptors to the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers (PubMed:8910519, PubMed:9121475, PubMed:31570889). Involved in a microtubule-dependent signal that is required for the myosin contractile ring formation during cell cycle cytokinesis (PubMed:16236794, PubMed:12900402). Plays an essential role in cleavage furrow formation. Required for the apical junction formation of keratinocyte cell-cell adhesion (PubMed:20974804, PubMed:23940119). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). The MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway plays an important role in ERBB2- dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex. It controls the localization of APC and CLASP2 to the cell membrane, via the regulation of GSK3B activity. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of the MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization (PubMed:20937854). Regulates KCNA2 potassium channel activity by reducing its location at the cell surface in response to CHRM1 activation; promotes KCNA2 endocytosis (PubMed:9635436, PubMed:19403695). Acts as an allosteric activator of guanine nucleotide exchange factor ECT2 by binding in its activated GTP-bound form to the PH domain of ECT2 which stimulates the release of PH inhibition and promotes the binding of substrate RHOA to the ECT2 catalytic center (PubMed:31888991). May be an activator of PLCE1 (PubMed:16103226). In neurons, involved in the inhibition of the initial spine growth. Upon activation by CaMKII, modulates dendritic spine structural plasticity by relaying CaMKII transient activation to synapse-specific, long-term signaling (By similarity).

Can bind phosphoceramides with a variety of aliphatic chains, but has a preference for lipids with saturated C16:0 or monounsaturated C18:1 aliphatic chains, and is inefficient with phosphoceramides containing lignoceryl (C24:0). Plays a role in the regulation of the cellular levels of ceramide-1- phosphate, and thereby contributes to the regulation of phospholipase PLA2G4A activity and the release of arachidonic acid. Has no activity with galactosylceramide, lactosylceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidic acid and ceramide. C1P transfer is stimulated by phosphatidylserine in C1P source vesicles (PubMed:28011644). Regulates autophagy, inflammasome mediated IL1B and IL18 processing, and pyroptosis, but not apoptosis (PubMed:29164996). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23863933, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28011644, ECO:0000269|PubMed:29164996}.",

        "description": "FUNCTION: Signal transducer and transcription activator that mediates cellular responses to interferons (IFNs), cytokine KITLG/SCF and other cytokines and other growth factors (PubMed:34508746, PubMed:35568036). Following type I IFN (IFN-alpha and IFN-beta) binding to cell surface receptors, signaling via protein kinases leads to activation of Jak kinases (TYK2 and JAK1) and to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STATs dimerize and associate with ISGF3G/IRF- 9 to form a complex termed ISGF3 transcription factor, that enters the nucleus (PubMed:28753426, PubMed:35568036). ISGF3 binds to the IFN stimulated response element (ISRE) to activate the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISG), which drive the cell in an antiviral state. In response to type II IFN (IFN-gamma), STAT1 is tyrosine- and serine- phosphorylated (PubMed:26479788). It then forms a homodimer termed IFN- gamma-activated factor (GAF), migrates into the nucleus and binds to the IFN gamma activated sequence (GAS) to drive the expression of the target genes, inducing a cellular antiviral state. Becomes activated in response to KITLG/SCF and KIT signaling. May mediate cellular responses to activated FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and FGFR4. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12764129, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12855578, ECO:0000269|PubMed:15322115, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19088846, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26479788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28753426, ECO:0000269|PubMed:34508746, ECO:0000269|PubMed:35568036, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8156998, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9724754}.",

Also catalyzes the oxygenation of arachidonate into 8- hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (8-HPETE) and 12- hydroperoxyicosatetraenoate (12-HPETE) (PubMed:23246375). Displays lipoxin synthase activity being able to convert (15S)-HETE into a conjugate tetraene (PubMed:31664810). Although arachidonate is the preferred substrate, this enzyme can also metabolize oxidized fatty acids derived from arachidonate such as (15S)-HETE, eicosapentaenoate (EPA) such as (18R)- and (18S)-HEPE or docosahexaenoate (DHA) which lead to the formation of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPM) lipoxin and resolvins E and D respectively, therefore it participates in anti-inflammatory responses (PubMed:21206090, PubMed:31664810, PubMed:8615788, PubMed:17114001, PubMed:32404334). Oxidation of DHA directly inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and sprouting angiogenesis via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) (By similarity). It does not catalyze the oxygenation of linoleic acid and does not convert (5S)-HETE to lipoxin isomers (PubMed:31664810). In addition to inflammatory processes, it participates in dendritic cell migration, wound healing through an antioxidant mechanism based on heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) regulation expression, monocyte adhesion to the endothelium via ITGAM expression on monocytes (By similarity). Moreover, it helps establish an adaptive humoral immunity by regulating primary resting B cells and follicular helper T cells and participates in the CD40-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) after CD40 ligation in B cells through interaction with PIK3R1 that bridges ALOX5 with CD40 (PubMed:21200133). May also play a role in glucose homeostasis, regulation of insulin secretion and palmitic acid-induced insulin resistance via AMPK (By similarity). Can regulate bone mineralization and fat cell differentiation increases in induced pluripotent stem cells (By similarity). {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:P48999, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17114001, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19022417, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21200133, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21206090, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21233389, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22516296, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23246375, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24282679, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24893149, ECO:0000269|PubMed:31664810, ECO:0000269|PubMed:32404334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8615788, ECO:0000269|PubMed:8631361}.",
